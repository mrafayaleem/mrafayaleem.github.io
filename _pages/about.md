Hey, welcome to my personal site. If you have landed here, I would assume that you are definitely interested in my profile.

This a quick intro about my personal and professional life. I was born in [Karachi, Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi) where I lived until high school. I moved to Islamabad to pursue my undergrad in Software Engineering from [National University of Sciences and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Sciences_and_Technology_(Pakistan)). Right after my graduation, I got an opportunity to work for [Dubizzle OLX](https://dubai.dubizzle.com/) in Dubai as a Backend Software Engineer. I must say that this was one of those career defining opportunities that I would always remember. I am thankful to the people who hired a fresh graduate, mentored him and helped him launch his career.

After about 3 years in Dubai, I moved to Vancouver, Canada to work for a startup, [Wiivv](https://wiivv.com/), that manufactures 3D printed insoles. This was my first ever taste of a true startup culture and I am glad that it worked out very well for me.

Meanwhile, I had always wanted to get closer to "data" so I decided to pursue a Master's in Computer Science with specialization in Big Data in 2018. I will be graduating in December 2019 so I am definitely looking for opportunities in Data Science and Data Engineering domain. I am also currently interning at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) as a Data Engineer.

Besides my work life, I love to play guitar. If you are ambitiously trying to find out more, you will find me on SoundCloud. Some of my favourite artists in no particular order are Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, [Vital Signs](https://sites.google.com/site/vitalsignsfansite/), Junoon, Iron Maiden, Metallica and Pink Floyd.

I also keep on track with Formula 1 news and have a weakness for fast cars. Other sports that I tend to follow is Cricket, Football and Basketball.

Ever since I moved to Canada, I have also got very interested in financial markets and love to learn and play around with ETFs, stocks and other portfolio jargons.

These days, I am a bit obsessed with fitness and recently joined Boxfit classes. It's somewhat similar to Crossfit with a lot of boxing. I would highly recommend it.  

If you have read it this far and would like to know more, I would love to grab a coffee. Please feel free to reach me out. All my contact details can be found in this site.

Cheers!
