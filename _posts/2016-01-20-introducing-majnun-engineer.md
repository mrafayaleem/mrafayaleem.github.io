title: Introducing Majnun Engineer
---

My very first attempt at setting up a personal blog cum website which I am hoping to maintain for a really long time. This is set up using Github pages and a Jekyll theme called Hyde. I have called it Majnun Engineer because of my love for engineering and the fact that I am listening to [Layla](https://soundcloud.com/mrafayaleem/layla-unplugged-guitar-cover) right now.
